# PHASE 10 OF 10 — MULTI-CATEGORY EXPANSION, INTEGRATION TESTING & PRODUCTION HARDENING

## ROLE & CONTEXT

You are a senior staff engineer responsible for taking a working prototype to production-grade reliability. Phases 1–9 built the complete Spec Factory for the `mouse` category. This final phase proves the system is **category-agnostic** by expanding to at least 2 additional categories (monitor + keyboard), builds comprehensive end-to-end integration tests, and hardens every component for 24/7 unattended operation.

This is the "prove it works at scale" phase. The mouse category is your proof-of-concept. If the same pipeline, the same FieldRulesEngine, the same Review Grid, the same publishing system works equally well for monitors and keyboards — each with completely different field sets, sources, and component databases — then the architecture is validated.

**Dependencies:** ALL Phases 1–9 must be complete and working for the `mouse` category.

---

## MISSION (NON-NEGOTIABLE — FINAL PHASE)

Build a 24/7, evidence-first "Spec Factory" that can publish 15–20 products per day with ~99% accuracy on expected fields by: (1) strict per-category field contracts, (2) multi-round web + helper-source pipeline with per-field citations, (3) helper artifacts for speed/consistency, (4) Data Review Grid with overrides.

**THIS PHASE PROVES** the system achieves this goal across MULTIPLE product categories, not just one.

## WHAT THIS PHASE DELIVERS

### Deliverable 10A: Monitor Category (Full Build-Out)

Complete the entire Phase 1–9 cycle for the `monitor` category:
- ~200 fields covering panel, backlight, HDR, connectivity, response times, calibration
- Component DBs: panels (IPS/VA/TN/OLED manufacturers), scalers, backlights, stand types
- Source registry: manufacturer sites, RTINGS monitors, TFTCentral, DisplaySpecifications.com
- 30 golden-file test fixtures from well-known monitors
- Full pipeline run producing published output

### Deliverable 10B: Keyboard Category (Full Build-Out)

Complete the entire Phase 1–9 cycle for the `keyboard` category:
- ~180 fields covering switches, keycaps, stabilizers, PCB, layout, features
- Component DBs: switches (Cherry/Gateron/Kailh/etc.), keycap profiles, stabilizers
- Source registry: manufacturer sites, RTINGS keyboards, keyboard review sites
- 30 golden-file test fixtures
- Full pipeline run producing published output

### Deliverable 10C: Comprehensive Integration Test Suite

End-to-end tests that:
- Run the COMPLETE pipeline for 10 products per category (30 total)
- Verify every stage: compile → crawl → identity → extract → validate → review → publish
- Compare output against golden files
- Measure accuracy, coverage, cost, and throughput
- Run in CI/CD (GitHub Actions / local)
- Detect regressions across ALL categories simultaneously

### Deliverable 10D: Production Hardening

Reliability improvements:
- Error recovery for every failure mode
- Data integrity checks (corrupted files, partial writes)
- Memory leak prevention for long-running daemon
- Disk space management (auto-cleanup of old evidence)
- API quota management (Gemini, DeepSeek rate limits)
- Comprehensive logging (structured JSON, log rotation)
- Health checks and self-healing
- Documentation (README, architecture docs, runbooks)

### Deliverable 10E: Performance Optimization

Speed and cost improvements:
- Parallel processing tuning (optimal concurrency per category)
- LLM cache warm-up (pre-cache common brand patterns)
- Incremental re-crawl (only fetch changed pages)
- Spec table template caching (brand-specific CSS selectors)
- Batch publishing (publish 20 products in one Excel file)
- Database indexing for SQLite output

```

### Memory Management

```javascript
// Long-running daemon memory management:

// 1. Browser pool: recycle Playwright contexts every 50 pages
const MAX_PAGES_PER_CONTEXT = 50;
let pageCount = 0;

async function getPage() {
  if (pageCount >= MAX_PAGES_PER_CONTEXT) {
    await currentContext.close();
    currentContext = await browser.newContext(contextOptions);
    pageCount = 0;
  }
  pageCount++;
  return currentContext.newPage();
}

// 2. Evidence cleanup: after publishing, compress and archive old evidence
// 3. LLM cache: LRU eviction when cache exceeds 1GB
// 4. Log rotation: Pino with daily rotation, 7-day retention
// 5. Heap snapshots: periodic V8 heap snapshot for leak detection
```

### Disk Space Management

```javascript
// Auto-cleanup policy:
const CLEANUP_RULES = {
  evidence_raw_html: { retain_days: 30, compress_after_days: 7 },
  evidence_cleaned_text: { retain_days: 90, compress_after_days: 30 },
  llm_cache: { max_size_gb: 2, eviction: 'lru' },
  published_versions: { retain_count: 5 },  // Keep last 5 versions per product
  logs: { retain_days: 30, rotate: 'daily' },
  golden_file_runs: { retain_count: 10 }    // Keep last 10 benchmark runs
};
```
